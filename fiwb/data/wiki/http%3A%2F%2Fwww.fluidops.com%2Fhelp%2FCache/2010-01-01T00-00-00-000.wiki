== Manual Cache Invalidation ==

The {{PRODUCT}} uses multiple caches to improve the system performance at runtime. 

[[Admin:Cache|Admin:Cache]] provides a UI to manually invalidate the caches. You may either clear individual caches or all of them at once. Currently, the following caches exist:

*contexts
*images
*instances
*inverse properties
*labels
*properties
*types
*auto suggestion
