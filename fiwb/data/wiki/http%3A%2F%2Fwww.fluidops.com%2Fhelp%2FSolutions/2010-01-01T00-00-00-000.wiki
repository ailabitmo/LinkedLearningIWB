== Installing solutions ==

The {{PRODUCT}} can be configured, customized and extended in various ways, including:

* Existing providers can be [[Help:Providers|added/configured]], custom providers can be [[Help:ProviderSDK|developed]].
* Semantic data can be [[Help:RDFImport|imported]] along with [[Help:GettingStarted|namespace definitions]].
* Wiki pages can be [[Help:Wiki|added]].
* The system can be adapted to the environment by editing [[Help:Installation|property-configuration]] or other configuration files.

While the {{PRODUCT}} easily allows to make use of these various configuration options, these customizations can also be packaged into a single artifact that can be installed all in one. Please refer to [[Help:PlatformSDK]] for details.

The following sections describe how such an artifact can be installed.

=== Installation of a Customization Artifact ===

==== Installation at startup ====

When the {{PRODUCT}} is started it checks the folder

 apps

for a zip-archive having the suffix <code>.zip</code>. The first one found is unpacked to a temporary folder and gets installed in the {{PRODUCT}}. After a successful installation the zip file is renamed to ''<nowiki><zipFile.zip></nowiki>.<nowiki><TIMESTAMP></nowiki>''.  The application is automatically restarted, if this is required to activate all changes of the solution. If the installation was only partially successful, the zip file is kept and the system will try to install again on the next (manual) restart.

==== Installation at Runtime ====

Given a URL of an solution artifact it can be installed at runtime through the remote API of the {{PRODUCT}}. This could for example be accessed through the [[Help:CLI|CLI]]. Once logged into the CLI a solution can be installed as follows:

 getSolutionService install -solutionArtifact http://host/path/solution.zip
 
Even if the solution requires a restart to become fully active, this restart is not triggered automatically. However it can be triggered manually by using the cli-command ''restart''.
