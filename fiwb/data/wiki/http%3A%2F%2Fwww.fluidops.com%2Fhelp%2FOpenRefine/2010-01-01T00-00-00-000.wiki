== Open Refine ==
The {{PRODUCT}} enables you to import data from an Open Refine project, where the data can be cleaned, transformed into RDF and integrated into the {{PRODUCT}} with ease. Open Refine is a data conversion and clean-up tool that allows one to transform messy data from a variety of formats into different formats.

<!--  Open Refine supports export of RDF data after installing an extension like e.g. the [http://refine.deri.ie/ GRefine RDF Extension]. For more information about how to use and install Open Refine visit the [http://openrefine.org/ Open Refine project page].

=== Using Open Refine ===

# Download [http://openrefine.org/ Open Refine] and install it following the Open Refine [https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions installation instructions].
# Download the [http://refine.deri.ie/ OpenRefine RDF Extension], extract the downloaded zip file to the '''extensions''' folder (in your Open Refine workspace) and restart Open Refine.
# Import your data file into Open Refine (e.g. in Excel, CSV, XML, RDF/XML, or in JSON format). You can clean, transform and augment your data in Open Refine as described in [http://openrefine.org/OpenRefine/documentation Open Refine Documentation].
# Define an RDF Skeleton to prepare your data for RDF export following the [http://refine.deri.ie/rdfExportDocs instructions] and the [http://refine.deri.ie/rdfExport example]. 

=== Importing Data from Open Refine ===

To import the data from a Open Refine project into the {{PRODUCT}} make sure the Open Refine is running and follow the steps:

* Navigate to '''Admin:Import''' and select the '''Open Refine''' tab.
* Enter a valid name for the value of '''context''' e.g. ''<nowiki>http://myRefinedData.com</nowiki>''.
* Enter the number of the project into the '''Project''' input field. The project number is the last part of the Open Refine project's url.
