== Bootstrapping the Application ==

This section explains how the application can be bootstrapped with ''data'', ''ontologies'' and ''wiki pages''.

As described in [[Help:BuildingSolutions]], the solution structure offers the possibility to locate bootstrap files in the ''data'' directory of the solution, in particular

* '''data/dbBootstap''': a folder containing RDF files in any supported format (e.g. N-Triples)
* '''data/ontologies''': ontology files as *.owl in RDF/XML format
* '''data/wikiBootstrap''': a set of wiki pages or templates, one file for each page (Filenames are assumed to be URL-encoded resource-URIs)

Files located in one of these directories will be automatically bootstrapped at startup time of the application or at installation time of the solutions.

Please refer to [[Help:BuildingSolutions]] (section for wiki pages) for details and best practices of wiki page development.
