== Views and Navigation ==
The user interface of the {{PRODUCT}} follows a resource-centric presentation scheme, i.e. every resource has exactly one page associated that displays resource-related data in a transparent way. Each such resource page offers different views on the resource content (represented as tabs on the left side). Depending on the system configuration the following views are visible:

# Semantic Wiki
# Structured Data View
# Graph View
# Pivot View

These four system views offer (partially overlapping) information related to the current resource, while implementing different interaction paradigms, namely (i) a Semantic Wiki that allows to quickly view, edit and annotate resources, (ii) a table view that provides a good survey on available structured data and supports the editing of data, (iii) a graph view that visualizes the underlying data graph and is useful for browsing the data repository, and (iv) a Pivot view that allows to interactively explore the data set. 

Using the HTTP request parameter ''view'' it is possible to link to one of the views directly:

<source>
?view=[wiki|table|graph|pivot]
</source>

The configuration of the views can be done resource-centric using the [[Help:WidgetConfiguration| widget configuration]] or via special [[Help:UserManagement| access level controls]]. See also the documentation for [[Help:UICustomization| UI customization]] in the platform SDK.

The following subsections explain the characteristics and features of the different views in more detail.

=== Semantic Wiki ===

The Semantic Wiki view allows to visualize information using standard wiki markup syntax. Besides textual content, it provides means for embedding interactive UI components - the [[Help:Widgets| widgets]] in a fully declarative way. Particularly noteworthy is the template engine, which automatically instantiates available template pages for resources (if defined). For the full set of functionality of this view and how to use it, please find detailed information in [[Help:Wiki|Using the Semantic Wiki]].

=== Structured Data View  ===

The Structured Data View (also called ''Table View'') visualizes all structured data associcated to the current resource, i.e., the outgoing and incoming properties and their values. Based on the [[Help:TripleEditorWidget| triple editor widget]], the information is clustered in groups using information from the underlying ontology. Additional information (such as contextual information or information about data types) can be accessed by hovering over the information icon <img src="../images/info.gif"  width="16px"/> next to each value.

Not only provides this view a means for visualizing existing data, but also for editing it. Depending on the [[Help:UserManagement| access level configuration]] users will see an edit button to open the edit mode. In this form based UI, existing data can be easily edited seamlessly, and new data can be added. Depending on the underlying ontology, the user is provided with meaningful auto suggestions and UI components (e.g. a date picker). In addition, any provided user input is validated using information from the ontology (in particular the domain and range of properties). Note that read-only data is marked as such using red-dots.

=== Graph View ===

The graph view provides a two-dimensional visualization of the data in a connected graph. By default it is configured in such a way that it displays the neighborhood of the current resource (i.e., its outgoing and incoming properties and values). However, this can be easily customized by configuring the [[Help:GraphWidget| graph widget]] in the [[Help:WidgetConfiguration| widget configuration]]. By clicking on one of the nodes, it is possible to seamlessly navigate the data graph.

=== Pivot View  ===

The Pivot View is a UI component allowing for visual exploration of the data. Users can explore the data using drill-downs by facets or filtering on different aspects. The view also allows clustering according to different dimenesions. Details about this view are provided on the [[Help:PivotWidget | Pivot Widget]] page.
