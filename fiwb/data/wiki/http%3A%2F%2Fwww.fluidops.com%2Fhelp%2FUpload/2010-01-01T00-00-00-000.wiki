=== Uploading Files ===
You can upload files into the {{PRODUCT}} or manage your uploaded files using the 
[[Admin:Upload | file upload page]]. 

# Prepare the file(s) for upload.
# Select the files you want to upload into the {{PRODUCT}} in the file browse dialogue. You may select several files at a time for upload.
# Click "Upload" and the selected files are automatically uploaded to the server. 
# Depending on the size of your files to be uploaded, this step may take a while. The progress bar over the "Upload" button will show the upload progress.

Additionally you can select an extractor. Extractors are used to compute metadata from your uploaded files. 
* The Basic extractor works on any file-type and extract minimal metadata like the filename and an upload timestamp.
* [http://openup.tso.co.uk/ OpenUp] and [http://www.temis.com/ Luxid] extractors work on files of the following file types: 
** .pdf (requires additional libraries) 
** .docx
** .pptx
** .html
** .txt
In every case, text is extracted from your files and forwarded to the corresponding web service. The metadata returned by these services is stored in the local store. The system needs to be properly configured to use these services. See the [[Help:Configuration | configuration help page]] for the relevant parameters.

=== Overview of Uploaded Files ===

Below the controls to upload new files the file upload page lists all files that you have uploaded into the {{PRODUCT}} along with:

* a link to the associated resource (only links to a meaningful page if the ''Basic Extractor'' was used),
* the media type,
* a last modification timestamp,
* the size,
* a link to download the file,


=== Deleting Uploaded Files ===

The delete button below the table along with the checkboxes in the left-most column can be used to delete individual files.

=== Using Uploaded Files in a Wiki Page ===

==== Embedding Images ====

If you want to embed uploaded images into your pages you can also use the general  [ http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Images media wiki syntax ]. This would be probably the best way to display images that you have uploaded using the [[Admin:Upload | File Upload UI]]. E.g. if the name of your uploaded image is ''DemoImage.png'' you can embed this file as an image (you can use the image symbol from the editor menu for assistance) like this:
<source>
[[File:DemoImage.png]]
</source> 

==== Linking Other Types of Files  ====

A central feature has considerably contributed to the success of wikis is the possibility to interlink information. 


Syntactically, links are created by enclosing the name of the uploaded file we want to link to into squared brackets:

<source>More information can be found in [[File:DemoText.txt]].</source>

This text is then translated into HTML code linking to the respective file.

It is also possible to change the text that is displayed, by separating it with a | symbol:

<source>More information can be found in [[File:DemoText.txt|this document]].</source>

A comprehensive description of other link types (like page-internal or wiki-external links) is beyond the scope of this manual, but can be found on the MediaWiki links help page at [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links].
